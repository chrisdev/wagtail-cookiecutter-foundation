 These projects come with a number of useful pages and a prebuilt content structure that will save you a tonne of work. Did I say that it automatically sets up SSL for your site using Letsencrypt!
 
Getting Started
---------------
Here is how we create a new Django project quickly while letting cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

To get started we assume the following dependencies are installed on your development enviroment ::
    
    pip
    virtualenv/pyvenv/virtualenvwrapper
    PostgreSQL

Get Cookiecutter ::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/paleocore/wagtail-cookiecutter-foundation

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them as illustrated in the video below.

   :target: https://youtu.be/n6judH8PTwY

A full featured Wagtail project will be generated for you. Enter the project ::

    $ cd wagtail_project/

Create a git repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:cclarke/my_site.git
    $ git push -u origin master
    
To create your project's virtual environment, install all pip dependencies, create the development database, run migrations and load initial data to database, install front-end dependencies and finally start the development server for you run ::

	make develop_env

You can access your site at ``http://localhost:8000``. The Admin back-end is available at ``http://localhost:8000/admin/``.The default Admin username is *admin* and The default Admin password is *admin123*.

Up and Running - Provisioning and Deployment
--------------------------------------------

Once you've created your project you can use the bundled `make` commands to to easily deploy and provision your site on platforms like Linode and Digital Ocean. We also support platforms like PythonAnywhere and Aldryn Cloud.  The video below shows the process for a DigitalOcean droplet running Ubuntu 16.04.  

.. image:: http://img.youtube.com/vi/mSffkWuCkgQ/sddefault.jpg

We're assuming that you've already created a DO droplet and you've added the project owner's public SSH keys to the droplet. Due to the fact the DO Ubuntu 16.04 droplets don't come with the necessary Python dependencies to support serverside Ansible, the first thing we need to run is::

   $ make pre_task 

Next we run ::

    $ make deploy_user

This creates a deployment user on the Droplet. The playbook will pause so you can copy your SSH public key to your projects keystore directory. At the end of this task (play), the deployment user is created and the public keys are downloaded to the keystore. You must add them to  the Bitbucket or GitHub VCS repo that your project. We support both private and public repos here. 

At this point, you're ready to provision, secure your server and deploy your code to the droplet. However, you may wish to pause and make changes to your project's 12 Factor settings which are stored  in file called `env.example`. The secrets have been automagically generated using `Sys random` but you may want to use your own values. Once you are satisfied run ::

   $ make provision

This will:

* Install all the required Linux packages and libraries on the server.
* Setup basic security on the using UFW Firewall and fail2ban.
* Install and configure PostgresSQL.
* Install and configure Nginx for SSL serving using Letsencrypt
* Install and configure Redis and ElasticSearch.
* Clone the projectâ€™s VCS repository, setup a virtual environment and install all Python dependencies
* Setup Gunicorn and Supervisor
* Configure and install a Celery worker process

Once the the playbook in done, you can check out your site at https://production_host_name. The Admin back-end is available at http://production_host_name/admin/. The Django SuperUser name and password are to be found in your project's `ansible/host_vars/production_host_name`: 

Our `Documentation`_ provides deatiled instructions for deploying on `PythonAnywhere`_ and `Aldryn Cloud`_.
